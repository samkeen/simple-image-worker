Image Worker
============

This is a simple implementation of a Python process that can perform various image manipulations.
It is meant to be used as a worker, watching a queue for work.
Planning to utilize it for a online course I am developing on Udemy.

Implementation Notes
********************

Tested on Python ``3.5.x``

Using the `Pillow library <http://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/handbook/tutorial.html>`_ for the actual image
manipulations.
